# PokemonCompose

This repo demonstrates the Pokemon API built using:
Kotlin Programming Language
Jetpack Compose, 
MVVM, 
Dagger-Hilt,
Room ORM,
Retrofit, 
Moshi - Json object Converter,
Timber - logging library
and Glide image library

The packages are structured using a very minimal represenation of CLEAN Architecture.

Note: One caveat - At the moment search functionality is not updated in the Compose list but shown in the Timbre logcat output
